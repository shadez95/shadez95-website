## Who am I?

I'm shadez95 and I like to do a lot of stuff. I'm into classic cars and trucks, technology, science, PC gaming, software development, outdoors, and many other things. Not to mention, I love to tinker with things, electronics, mechanical objects like engines, tools, etc.

## New Site

It's taken me awhile, but I have finally finished my new website. I would have finished sooner, but you know, real life stuff. This new website is also open sourced and can be improved by others or used as template to build their own site. Please, feel free to let me know if I could improve something by submitting a PR, an issue, or reaching out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shadez95). I do know one thing for sure that can be improved and that is SEO. Adding meta tags for twitter cards and open graph support would be hugely beneficial.

## What to expect from the this blog...

I intend to post about stuff going on in my life related to what I like to do and if I think many of you will find it interesting. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shadez95) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/shadez95) to keep up to date with me. As for my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRuJSH_5UEtbEeuD04yGeRw) channel, expect to see PC game play, tutorials, maybe even some outdoor videos of me fishing or hunting, not too sure.
